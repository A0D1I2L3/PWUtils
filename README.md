# PWUtils

Some of the utilities I made to facilitate me while using PhysicsWallah's website.

# Dark Mode

Since there is no dark mode released officially yet, here is the custom one I made, to be honest, it just works :)

### Installation
- Open [DarkMode.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireHead90544/PWUtils/main/darkmode.js) and copy all of it's contents.
- Open [PW's Website](https://study.physicswallah.live/) and login.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` to open Inspect Element Window.
- Head over to the `Console` tab.
- Paste the code you copied earlier and press enter.
- Enjoy your **Dark Mode >_<**
**Note:** You need to do this everytime you open the website, i.e "refresh" the page or open the website in another tab, so better save this somewhere from where you can access it quickly. Though, you won't need to repeat the steps until you don't refresh the page. 

### Usage
You will see two additional buttons on the left sidebar as shown below.

- **Change Theme** - This button will allow you to change theme from light to dark and vice versa. [Shortcut Keybind: `Shift + Alt + D`]
- **Fix Images** - This button will attempt to fix the inversion caused in the images as well. [Shortcut Keybind: `Shift + Alt + F`]


# KeyConVP

Pausing/Seeking requires user to use mouse by clicking the buttons. This allows you to control the video player using keyboard.

### Installation
- Open [PlayerControls.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FireHead90544/PWUtils/main/playercontrols.js) and copy all of it's contents.
- Open [PW's Website](https://study.physicswallah.live/) and login.
- Open the lecture/video you want to watch
- Play the video and pause it once.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` to open Inspect Element Window.
- Head over to the `Console` tab.
- Paste the code you copied earlier and press enter.
- Done :D


**Note:** You need to do this everytime you open the website, i.e "refresh" the page or open the website in another tab, so better save this somewhere from where you can access it quickly. Though, you won't need to repeat the steps until you don't refresh the page. 

### Usage
- **Spacebar** - Play/Pause
- **Left Arrow** - Seek Backward (10s)
- **Right Arrow** - Seek Forward (10s)

**Note:** Do not click on seek buttons (using mouse) after entering the code, else the spacebar keyboard control will not work properly (problem with the video player itself, and I can't do anything about it), though if you have clicked it, just click on play/pause button (using mouse) once and it will get fixed :)
